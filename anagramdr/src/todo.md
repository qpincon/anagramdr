- Have max 128 matchables words, transform Matching::matched to u128
- Change letter_pool to non-vector and store eventual duplicate letters alongside
  - Tricky as we encode diacritics: store all used letters somewhere and change letter_pool to indexes to those letters?
- Compute best permutations at the end
- Use parallel processing for best permutations
